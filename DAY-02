1. What is a flowchart? 
It is a diagram that represents a workflow or process. It is nothing but a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.

2. What are components of a flowchart?
It shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.
Some Important symbols (boxes) are:
   -  üîµOval - It marks the Start/End of the flow.
   -  ‚û°Ô∏èArrow - Connector which shows the flow of relationship between various symbols.
   -  ‚è∫Ô∏èParallelogram - It represents input and output.
   -  ‚èπÔ∏èRectangle - It represents a process.
   -  üî∂Diamond - It is used in decision formation.


3. What is Process? 
A process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed.

4. What is a Algorithm? 
An algorithm is a procedure or set of rules that defines how a program is to be executed. In the algorithm, plain text is used. The algorithm does not follow any rules

5. What is a Pseudocode? 
It is the mimic of a code. Represents code-like structure of a algorithm.
Example:

START
  INPUT num
  IF num MOD 2 == 0 THEN
       PRINT "Even number"
  ELSE
       PRINT "Odd number"
  ENDIF
END
