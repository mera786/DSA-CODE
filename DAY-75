🌟 OOPs Principles ?
OOP = Object-Oriented Programming
It focuses on objects, not just functions or logic.
Languages using OOP:
👉 Java, C++, Python, C#, Kotlin, Swift etc.

⭐ Why OOP?
OOP helps you to:
✔ write clean and readable code
✔ reuse code easily
✔ make applications secure
✔ divide big code into small parts (modularity)
✔ make code easier to maintain
✔ model real-world things (like Car, Student, Employee)

🧩 There are 4 Main OOP Principles
 Encapsulation
 Inheritance
 Polymorphism
 Abstraction

1️⃣ Encapsulation
What?
Wrapping data (variables) + methods (functions) together into a single unit → called Class.
Why?
✔ To protect data
✔ To control who can access what
✔ To prevent accidental changes
✔ To make code secure & manageable
🧩 Encapsulation Achieved in Two Ways :
   a. Field-level Encapsulation, To protect variables (data):
      ✔ How to achieve?
               - Make variables private
               - Provide public getters/setters to control access
   b. Method-level Encapsulation, To protect methods (logic):
      ✔ How to achieve?
                - Use access modifiers to control which methods are visible:
                                                       | Modifier    | Meaning                                     |
                                                       | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
                                                       | `private`   | Completely hidden (best for internal logic) |
                                                       | (default)   | Accessible inside same package              |
                                                       | `protected` | Accessible in subclasses                    |
                                                       | `public`    | Accessible by everyone                      |
Note:- isme hum data ko hee hide kr dete hai or apne according decide krte hai acess control.
