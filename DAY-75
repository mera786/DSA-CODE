🌟 OOPs Principles ?
OOP = Object-Oriented Programming
It focuses on objects, not just functions or logic.
Languages using OOP:
👉 Java, C++, Python, C#, Kotlin, Swift etc.

⭐ Why OOP?
OOP helps you to:
✔ write clean and readable code
✔ reuse code easily
✔ make applications secure
✔ divide big code into small parts (modularity)
✔ make code easier to maintain
✔ model real-world things (like Car, Student, Employee)

🧩 There are 4 Main OOP Principles
 Encapsulation
 Inheritance
 Polymorphism
 Abstraction

1️⃣ Encapsulation
What?
Wrapping data (variables) + methods (functions) together into a single unit → called Class.
Why?
✔ To protect data
✔ To control who can access what
✔ To prevent accidental changes
✔ To make code secure & manageable
🧩 Encapsulation Achieved in Two Ways :
   a. Field-level Encapsulation, To protect variables (data):
      ✔ How to achieve?
               - Make variables private
               - Provide public getters/setters to control access
   b. Method-level Encapsulation, To protect methods (logic):
      ✔ How to achieve?
                - Use access modifiers to control which methods are visible:
                                                       | Modifier    | Meaning                                     |
                                                       | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
                                                       | `private`   | Completely hidden (best for internal logic) |
                                                       | (default)   | Accessible inside same package              |
                                                       | `protected` | Accessible in subclasses                    |
                                                       | `public`    | Accessible by everyone                      |
Note:- isme hum data ko hee hide kr dete hai or apne according decide krte hai acess control.


2️⃣ What is Abstraction ?
Abstraction is hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features(like, Start/Stop engine,Accelerate / Brake without knowing how to start...)  to the user.
Think of it like: when you drive a car, you use the steering, brake, and accelerator without knowing how the engine works inside.
Why?
✔ To reduce complexity
✔ To show only necessary details
✔ To improve code maintainability
✔ To define a blueprint for other classes
🧩 How to Achieve Abstraction in Java
There are 2 main ways to achieve abstraction:
1️⃣ Using Abstract Classes 
2️⃣ Using Interfaces
🌟Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface ?
| Feature                          | Abstract Class                                                                    | Interface                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Object Creation**              | Cannot create object directly                                                     | Cannot create object directly                                                                                            |
| **Methods**                      | Can have **abstract methods** (without body) and **concrete methods** (with body) | All methods are **abstract by default** (before Java 8). From Java 8+, can have **default and static methods with body** |
| **Fields (Variables)**           | Can have **instance variables** of any type; can be non-final                     | Variables are **public, static, final by default** (constants)                                                           |
| **Constructors**                 | Can have constructors                                                             | Cannot have constructors                                                                                                 |
| **Multiple Inheritance**         | Supports **single inheritance only** (extends one class)                          | Supports **multiple inheritance** (a class can implement multiple interfaces)                                            |
| **Access Modifiers for Methods** | Can use `private`, `protected`, `public`                                          | Methods are **public by default** (cannot use private for abstract methods before Java 9)                                |
| **Inheritance**                  | `extends` keyword is used                                                         | `implements` keyword is used                                                                                             |
| **Purpose**                      | To provide **partial abstraction** + some shared code                             | To provide **full abstraction / contract** for classes                                                                   |
| **When to Use**                  | When classes are closely related and share **common code**                        | When classes are **unrelated** but must follow the same **rules/contract**                                               |
| **Default Implementation**       | Can provide **default method body**                                               | Java 8+ allows **default methods**; Java < 8, **no method body allowed**                                                 |
| **Static Methods**               | Can have static methods                                                           | Can have static methods (Java 8+)                                                                                        |

| **Implementation Detail** | Does **not hide implementation**, just restricts access                                                       | **Hides implementation**, shows only functionality                                                    |
| **What it hides**         | Hides **data** (variables)                                                                                    | Hides **logic/implementation** (how something works)                                                  |
