Q1. 🧩 1️⃣ What is a Substring?
👉 A substring is a smaller part (or piece) of a larger string.
It is formed by taking continuous characters from the original string.
🔹 Example:
String str = "Hello";
All possible substrings are:
                            H, e, l, l, o,
                            He, Hel, Hell, Hello,
                            el, ell, ello,
                            ll, llo,
                            lo
🧮 2️⃣ Formula for Substring Count
If the length of string = n,
then the total number of substrings (excluding empty string) is:
                                                         Total substrings= n × (n + 1) / 2 ;


Q2. Follow up question :
    print substring of "abc "  ?
output Like,
a ab abc 
b bc 
c
