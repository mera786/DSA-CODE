Q1. 🔍 What is Linear Search?
Linear search is a basic searching technique in which we check each element one by one in a list or array until we find the target value (or reach the end).
🧩 Example:
Array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Target = 30
We check:
       10 → not match
       20 → not match
       30 → ✅ match found at index 2
Note: In Linear Search, the order of elements does not matter — you can search in unsorted or sorted arrays.

Q2. Follow up question :
find maximum value in the array ?
arr = {1,-2,-9,11,15,4,8};
hint :
1. -> consider first index at maximum and then compare 
or
2. -> intialize with possible mimum value ?



Q3. Follow up question :
find minimum value in the array ?
arr = {1,-2,-9,11,15,4,8};
hint :
1. -> consider first index at minimum and then compare 
or
2. -> intialize with possible maximum value ?
