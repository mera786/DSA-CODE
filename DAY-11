(1) What is Number System ?
 - Any number of Base N means that it has digits from 0 to N-1
 - Example Base 2 -> 0,1 Base 3 -> 0,1,2
 - Some special highlighted Bases are :
         - Binary -> Base 2 
         - Octal -> Base 8 
         - Decimal -> Base 10 
         - HexaDecimal -> Base 16 
Note: HexaDecimal has given some special names in the form of Alphabets to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. HexaDecimal -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

(2) Conversion of a number from Any base to Decimal ?
Suppose you want to convert a number of base 'x' to Decimal(Base 10). The approach is simple, To convert a number of any base to decimal, 
follow these steps:
         - Identify the base of the number.
         - Write down the digits of the number.
         - For each digit, multiply by the base raised to the power of its position, starting from the rightmost digit with position 0.
         - Sum all the products obtained from step 3.
Example: Convert the number 1011 from base 2 to decimal
Approach :
  - The base of the number is 2.
  - The digits of the number are 1, 0, 1, and 1. For each digit:
                                                   - a. The rightmost digit (1) is multiplied by 2^0 (1)
                                                   - b. The next digit to the left (1) is multiplied by 2^1 (2)
                                                   - c. The next digit to the left (0) is multiplied by 2^2 (0) 
                                                   - d. The leftmost digit (1) is multiplied by 2^3 (8)
                                                   - Sum the products: 1 + 2 + 8 = 11. Therefore, the decimal equivalent of the binary number 1011 is 11.

(3) Conversion of a number from Decimal to Any base ?
To convert a decimal number to any base,
follow these steps:
         - Identify the desired base.
         - Divide the decimal number by the base, and take the integer quotient as the next digit to the left.
         - Repeat step 2 using the remainder obtained in step 2 as the new decimal number.
         - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the quotient is 0.
         - The remainders obtained in step 3, read from bottom to top, represent the digits of the converted number. Example: Convert the decimal number 11 to base 2
         - The desired base is 2.
         - Divide 11 by 2: 11 / 2 = 5 with a remainder of 1.
         - Divide 5 by 2: 5 / 2 = 2 with a remainder of 1.
         - Divide 2 by 2: 2 / 2 = 1 with a remainder of 0.
         - Divide 1 by 2: 1 / 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1.
Note:- The remainders obtained in step 3, read from bottom to top, are the digits of the converted number: 1011. Therefore, the binary equivalent of the decimal number 11 is 1011.
