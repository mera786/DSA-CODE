(1) Count the Digits of a number lets say number is : 4567 ?
Steps to solve :
           - Take a number → say num = 4567
           - Initialize a counter → count = 0
           - Repeat while num > 0:
                    - Remove the last digit using num = num / 10
                    - Increase the counter → count++
           - When the loop finishes, count will have the total number of digits.
Note:- to handle specail condition like 0 for input : use if condition and directly print 1 .


(2) Check if a Number is armstrong or not. ?
👉 Short Definition:
A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of each of its digits raised to the power of total digits equals the number itself.
Example: Let’s take 153
                  → It has 3 digits                 
                  → So we do:  1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
🌟 Properties of ArmStrong number :
                   - All single-digit numbers (0–9) are Armstrong numbers.
                       👉 Because for example: 5 = 5¹ ✅
                   - Permutations of an Armstrong number are not always Armstrong
                       ❌ (e.g., 153 is Armstrong but 531 is not!)
                   - Armstrong numbers are not always palindromes.
                     ❌ For example, 153 ≠ 351 , Only a few are plindrome also (like 1, 0, to 9.).
                   - The sum of two Armstrong numbers is usually not an Armstrong number.
                     ❌ For example, 153 + 370 = 523,   5^3+2^3+3^3 =125+8+27 =160 !=523
Step-by-Step Logic to Check Armstrong Number :
                                - Take a number → e.g. 153
                                - Count how many digits it has → 3
                                - Extract each digit one by one
                                - Raise each digit to the power of total digits
                                - Add them together
                                - Compare the sum with the original number
                                                                 - If equal → ✅ Armstrong
                                                                 - Else → ❌ Not Armstrong


(3) check if a number is palindrome ?
👉 Short Definition:
A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
Example :
        121 → reverse is 121 → same → Palindrome  
        123 → reverse is 321 → not same → Not Palindrome
🌟 Properties of Palindrome Numbers :
      - All single-digit numbers (0–9) are palindromes.
                👉 Because reversing them gives the same number.
      - A palindrome number reads the same both ways.
                Example: 1221 → same from left and right.
      - Palindromes can also appear in strings (like “madam”, “level”) — not only in numbers.
Step-by-Step Logic to Check Palindrome Number :
Let’s take an example → 121
Step 1️⃣
  - Take the number and store it → original_num = 121
Step 2️⃣
  - Initialize reversed_num = 0
Step 3️⃣
    - Extract the last digit using num % 10
                       → Add it to reversed_num after multiplying by 10
                       → Remove the last digit from num using num = num / 10
Step 4️⃣
    - Repeat this until the number becomes 0.
Step 5️⃣
    - Compare:
             if (original_num == reversed_num)
            ✅ Palindrome
            else
            ❌ Not Palindrome
