Q1. 🔍 What is Linear Search?
Linear search is a basic searching technique in which we check each element one by one in a list or array until we find the target value (or reach the end).
🧩 Example:
Array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Target = 30
We check:
       10 → not match
       20 → not match
       30 → ✅ match found at index 2
Note: In Linear Search, the order of elements does not matter — you can search in unsorted or sorted arrays that's the reason it's benificial for this scinario.

Q2. given an array like, arr = {3,1,3,4,5,3}; now you have to do following questions :
    Qa. find first occurrence of 3 and return it's index ?
    Qb. find all occurrence of 3 and return their indexes ?
    Qc. find last occurrence of 3 and return it's index ?


Q3. Follow up question :
find maximum value in the array ?
arr = {1,-2,-9,11,15,4,8};
hint :
1. -> consider first index at maximum and then compare 
or
2. -> intialize with possible mimum value ?

Q4. Follow up question :
find 2nd maximum value in the array ?
arr = {1,-2,-9,11,15,4,8};


Q5. Follow up question :
find minimum value in the array ?
arr = {1,-2,-9,11,15,4,8};
hint :
1. -> consider first index at minimum and then compare 
or
2. -> intialize with possible maximum value ?

Q6. Follow up question :
find 2nd minimum value in the array ?
arr = {1,-2,-9,11,15,4,8};

Q1. given an 2D array like, 
 int [][] arr = {
                  {2,4,1,5,1},
                  {6,7,3,4,2},
                  {8,1,2,2,3},
                  {5,5,5,8,4},
                               };
  Qa. find first occurrence in 2D where target = 4 ?
   Hint: intialize two variable rowIndex = -1; , columnIndex = -1; and then use 2 loops then using condition compare target also exiting from both loop use labelled?
   Qb. find all occurrences in 2D array where target = 2 ? 
   Hint : find column size, based on column size create 2D array , use two loops.

Q2. find maximum sub-array sum  ?
 int [][] arr = {
                  {2,4,1,5,1},
                  {6,7,3,4,2},
                  {8,1,2,2,3},
                  {5,5,5,8,4},
                               };
 Hint : use two loops, two variable maxSum and currSum then compare .
