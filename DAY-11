                                            Maths For DSA

(1) What is Number System ?
 - Any number of Base N means that it has digits from 0 to N-1
 - Example Base 2 -> 0,1 Base 3 -> 0,1,2
 - Some special highlighted Bases are :
         - Binary -> Base 2 
         - Octal -> Base 8 
         - Decimal -> Base 10 
         - HexaDecimal -> Base 16 
Note: HexaDecimal has given some special names in the form of Alphabets to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. HexaDecimal -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F


(2) Short Explanation for Converting any number into Any Base ?
| **Conversion Direction** | **Which Base You Use**            | **Why (Simple Explanation)**                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Binary → Decimal**     | Base of given number (2)          | Because the number is already in base 2, so each digit’s value depends on 2’s powers (like 2⁰, 2¹, 2²…).                 |
| **Decimal → Binary**     | Base you’re converting **to** (2) | Because we want to get a binary number, so we keep dividing by 2 again and again to find the binary digits (remainders). |


(2) Conversion of a number from Any base to Decimal ?
follow these steps:
         - ✅ Step 1 — Know the base
               - Find out what base the number is in :
                                         - If it’s binary, base = 2
                                         - If it’s octal, base = 8
                                         - If it’s hexadecimal, base = 16
                                         👉 The base tells us how many digits that number system uses. For binary, only 0 and 1 are used.
         - ✅ Step 2 — Write down all digits
                                          - ex : Binary number = 1011
         - ✅ Step 3 — Give positions to each digit
                                          - Start from the right side and count positions from 0.
                                          - ex : 1 (pos 3)   0 (pos 2)   1 (pos 1)   1 (pos 0)
         - ✅ Step 4 — Multiply each digit
                                          - For each digit: Multiply the digit by (base ^ position)
                                          - ex : (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰)
         - ✅ Step 5 — Solve each part
                                   1 × 8 = 8
                                   0 × 4 = 0
                                   1 × 2 = 2
                                   1 × 1 = 1
         - ✅ Step 6 — Add them all
                                8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11

Example: Convert the number 1011 from base 2 to decimal ?



(3) Conversion of a number from Decimal to Any base ?
To convert a decimal number to any base,
follow these steps:
         - Identify the desired base.
         - Divide the decimal number by the base, and take the integer quotient as the next digit to the left.
         - Repeat step 2 using the remainder obtained in step 2 as the new decimal number.
         - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the quotient is 0.
         - The remainders obtained in step 3, read from bottom to top, represent the digits of the converted number. 
         - The desired base is 2.
         - Divide 11 by 2: 11 / 2 = 5 with a remainder of 1.
         - Divide 5 by 2: 5 / 2 = 2 with a remainder of 1.
         - Divide 2 by 2: 2 / 2 = 1 with a remainder of 0.
         - Divide 1 by 2: 1 / 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1.
Example: Convert the decimal number 11 to base 2
Note:- The remainders obtained in step 3, read from bottom to top, are the digits of the converted number: 1011. Therefore, the binary equivalent of the decimal number 11 is 1011.
