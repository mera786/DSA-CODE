🧠 What is Bit Masking (Simple Definition)
👉 Bit masking means using bitwise operators (like AND, OR, XOR, NOT) with a specific binary number (called a mask) to check, set, or clear certain bits of another number.
💡 Think of it like this:
A mask works like a filter — it “hides” or “shows” only the bits you want to work with.

Note:-
-> in even number like, 4(100) least significant bit (LSB) is always 0.
-> in odd number like, 9(1001) least significant bit (LSB) is always 1.

{
odd + odd = even 
even + odd  /  odd + even = odd
even + even = even 
}


Q1. How do you find the i-th bit of a number?


Find number is even or odd  ?
         -> if num & 1 == 1 then it is odd 
         -> otherwise it is even
