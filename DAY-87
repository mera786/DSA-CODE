What is LinkedList  ?
linkedlist is a linear data structure which is in the form of nodes in memory where one node knows the address of another nodes and
they are linked through this address
int linkedlist there are two parts :
a. store address
b. data (data can be one variable,two variable, three varible... , can be custom structure,cutom class anything)

first node called head of the linkedlist
last node called tail of the linkedlist

realworld example : music player
-> where can be go one step either one step forward or backward but at a time one step only

web browser :
-> suppose you have opened one by one you are opening multiple pages same way one one step you can go back on previous page

types of linkedlist :
                    singly linkedlist :
                      /         \
                     /           \
                 circuler      non-circuler
                 doubly linkedlist :
                      /         \
                     /           \
                 circuler      non-circuler

What is node ?
-> in java normally node is class(which manually we create) which is such entity which holds linkedlist data as well as address
how to create node ?
step 1 :
create class Node
step 2:
int rollNum (here we are creating node of rollnum)
Node next

how to implement linkedlist ?
step 1 :
required node
step 2 :


insertion in linkedlist are :
 3 
either insert at head, at specific possition or at tail
