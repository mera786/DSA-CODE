(1) What is Number System ?
 - Any number of Base N means that it has digits from 0 to N-1
 - Example Base 2 -> 0,1 Base 3 -> 0,1,2
 - Some special highlighted Bases are :
         - Binary -> Base 2 
         - Octal -> Base 8 
         - Decimal -> Base 10 
         - HexaDecimal -> Base 16 
Note: HexaDecimal has given some special names in the form of Alphabets to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. HexaDecimal -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F


(2) Short Explanation for Converting any number into Any Base ?
| **Conversion Direction** | **Which Base You Use**            | **Why (Simple Explanation)**                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Binary → Decimal**     | Base of given number (2)          | Use powers of 2 because the original number is in base 2.                          |
| **Decimal → Binary**     | Base you’re converting **to** (2) | Divide by 2 because we are creating a number in base 2.                            |


(3) Conversion of a number from Any base to Decimal ?
Example: Convert the number 1011 from binary base 2 to decimal ?   Output : 11
follow these steps:
         - ✅ Step 1 — Know the base
               - Find out what base the number is in :
                                         - If it’s binary, base = 2
                                         - If it’s octal, base = 8
                                         - If it’s hexadecimal, base = 16
                                         👉 The base tells us how many digits that number system uses. For binary, only 0 and 1 are used.
         - ✅ Step 2 — Write down all digits
                                          - ex : Binary number = 1011
         - ✅ Step 3 — Give positions to each digit
                                          - Start from the right side and count positions from 0.
                                          - ex : 1 (pos 3)   0 (pos 2)   1 (pos 1)   1 (pos 0)
         - ✅ Step 4 — Multiply each digit
                                          - For each digit: Multiply the digit by (base ^ position)
                                          - ex : (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰)
         - ✅ Step 5 — Solve each part
                                   1 × 8 = 8
                                   0 × 4 = 0
                                   1 × 2 = 2
                                   1 × 1 = 1
         - ✅ Step 6 — Add them all
                                8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11


(4) Conversion of a number from Decimal to Any base ?
Example: Convert the decimal number 11 to binary base 2 ?     Output : 1011 
follow these steps:
         - ✅ Step 1 — Know the base you want
                             - Decide which base you want to convert to.
                             - Example:
                                     - Binary → base = 2
                                     - Octal → base = 8
                                     - Hexadecimal → base = 16
                                     👉 The base tells us how many digits that number system uses. For binary, only 0 and 1 are used.
         - ✅ Step 2 — Divide the decimal number by the base
                             - Take the decimal number you have and divide it by the base you want.
                             - Write down the remainder — this is the digit of the new number.
                             - Example: Decimal number = 11, Base = 2   , 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1
                             - The remainder 1 is the rightmost digit of the binary number.
         - ✅ Step 3 — Repeat division
                             - Take the quotient from previous division and divide by the same base again.
                             - Write down the remainder each time.
                             - Repeat until the quotient becomes 0.
                                     | Step | Divide By | Quotient | Remainder |
                                     | ---- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
                                     | 1    | 11 ÷ 2    | 5        | 1         |
                                     | 2    | 5 ÷ 2     | 2        | 1         |
                                     | 3    | 2 ÷ 2     | 1        | 0         |
                                     | 4    | 1 ÷ 2     | 0        | 1         |
         - ✅ Step 4 — Read the remainders from bottom to top
                             - The first remainder at the bottom becomes the leftmost digit.
                             - The last remainder at the top becomes the rightmost digit.


(4) follow up question : reverse the number 5701 , output : 1075
Steps :
    - When you reverse a number, you repeatedly:
                              - extract the last digit (num % 10),
                              - add last digit to the result after multiplying by 10 into result,
                              - and then remove the last digit from num.
