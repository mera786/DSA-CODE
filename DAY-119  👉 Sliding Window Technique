Q1.  What is Sliding Window Technique ?
⭐ Sliding Window Technique :
Sliding Window is a technique used to solve problems on arrays or strings by using a small window (range) that moves (slides) from left to right.
Instead of checking all possible subarrays (which is slow), we create a window and:
         - Expand the window by moving the right pointer.
         - Shrink the window by moving the left pointer.
         - Keep track of something inside the window (sum, max, unique elements, etc.)
This helps convert O(n²) brute-force loops into O(n) efficient solutions.
⭐ When to Use Sliding Window?
Use it when the problem involves:
✔ Subarrays
✔ Substrings
✔ Consecutive elements
✔ Fixed size or variable-size ranges
✔ Conditions like: “longest”, “smallest”, “maximum sum”, “length”, “at most K distinct elements”

⭐ There are two types of sliding windows :
    - fixed size : here we are talking about fixed size window like k=3;
    - variable size: variable size works into two phase :
                                                      - expansion phase (badhna) :- adding into the window.
                                                      - shrinking phase (sheekudna) :- deleting from window.

⭐ How to solve any sliding window problem ?
STEPS for fixed size:
1.  intialize the window (k=3) so first calculate sum of three elements.
2.  solve for other elements
3.  calculate your answer (like, max, sumofsubarray,logestsubstringlength)
STEPS for variable size:
1.  directly goes to loop
2.  calculate your answer (like, max, sumofsubarray,logestsubstringlength)
